## Introduction

In this project, I modeled the MyCobot 280 robotic arm within a ROS2 workspace. The MyCobot 280 is a lightweight, collaborative robotic arm designed for various applications in research and education. Below, you'll find images of the robotic arm, both in its real-world setup and as modeled in simulation.
